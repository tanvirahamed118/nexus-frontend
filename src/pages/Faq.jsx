                    The number of requests varies from institution to
                    institution and from month to month. However, we do advise
                    our client to reconsider their offer in case there are few
                    requests from influencers. We do our best to allow brands to
                    have at least 20 requests per month.

                    When you decide to reject an influencer request, you don’t
                    need to provide a reason for your refusal. Influencers are
                    used to being rejected by establishments, they do not take
                    offense.

                    The deal for influencers is as follows: create a minimum of
                    3 stories by tagging the @restaurant. Food profiles usually
                    add a post/reels. If a brand would like to change these
                    conditions, we can discuss further depending on the offer
                    and their needs.
